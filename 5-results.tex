\chapter{Results and Discussion}
The research process resulted in numerous interesting findings, with implications both for understanding the behavior of the system, as well as for future design efforts considering multi-spacecraft surveys. These results will be presented and discussed in this chapter. Firstly, the effect of increasing or decreasing the number of spacecraft is discussed in \autoref{sec:results_number}. Then, possible payload compositions are assessed in \autoref{sec:results_payload}. Afterwards, the system's orbital elements, and how these are affected by the composition of the system, will be given discourse in \autoref{sec:results_orbits_one} and \autoref{sec:results_orbits_two} for spacecraft in identicial and differing trajectories, respectively. To aid in the interpretation of these results, a possible explanation for the underlying principle is presented in \autoref{sec:results_explanation}. Finishing the discussion, in \autoref{sec:results_performance}, predictions will be made with respect to the performance of an optimal multi-spacecraft survey system, and the impact on future design efforts will be discussed.

\section{Number of Spacecraft}
\label{sec:results_number}

 \label{fig:results_number_tir}
\end{figure}

As explained previously, the number of spacecraft in the system is a parameter that does not have an optimum with respect to the obtained survey completeness: adding additional spacecraft will logically never degrade the performance of the system. However, in practice other constraints (primarily economical) will be present. Therefore, the increase in performance resulting from such an increased investment is of particular interest. \autoref{fig:results_number_vis} and \autoref{fig:results_number_tir} show the performance increase obtained as a function of the number of spacecraft, for the visual spectrum and thermal infrared, respectively. Several observations can be made, which will be listed and subsequently discussed below.\\

Firstly, significant diminishing returns present themselves for both spectra; the additional value of an extra spacecraft decreases exponentially with the number of spacecraft already present in the system. Performance increases gained per additional spacecraft fall to around 5\% when surpassing 5 spacecraft in the system. Beyond 10 spacecraft, the increases start to fall below the variance in the results, leading to the appearance that addition of spacecraft would yield a decrease in performance, which is logically not the case. This means that, although large initial improvements in performance can be gained from utilizing a multi-spacecraft system, simply increasing the number of survey spacecraft can not bring us arbitrarily close to 100\% survey completeness; when increasing beyond approximately 5 spacecraft, it is recommended to focus efforts on improving other areas of the system for the mission to remain efficient. \\

This fact compounds the second finding: even the most efficient addition - adding a second spacecraft to a single spacecraft survey system - does not come close to increasing the system performance by 100\%. In other words: increasing the number of spacecraft will \textit{decrease} the number of asteroids detected \textit{per spacecraft}. While this finding might seem irrelevant from a mission design point-of-view, as the overall performance still increases, it is nevertheless important to consider in the context of other mission constraints, such as budget. \\

The third result is that thermal infrared systems feature a larger relative improvement to survey performance as the number of spacecraft increases, i.e. thermal infrared systems benefit more from additional spacecraft. This trend continues for higher numbers of spacecraft, with thermal infrared systems reaching a 100\% improvement around 7-8 spacecraft, compared to visual light systems requiring 15-16 spacecraft to achieve a similar performance gain. This, combined with the fact that thermal infrared systems have been shown to be the best choice for future NEA missions (see e.g. \cite{2017NEOSDT}, \cite{ThesisOlga}), suggests a multi-spacecraft system should also comprise thermal infrared telescopes. This will be investigated in more detail in \autoref{sec:results_payload}.\\

Finally, it is evident that a variance of around 1-2\% is present in the survey performance results, relative to a smooth exponentially decreasing curve. It was found that this variance is also present when repeatedly sampling the simulation using the same input parameters. Therfore, in these and subsequent results, it will be assumed that this is simply a result of the stochasticity in the model. Possible other explanations will be ruled out further in REFF.

\section{Payload}
\label{sec:results_payload}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/tir_vs_vis_many.png}
 \caption{Comparison of relative increase in performance gained relative to a single spacecraft system for visual and thermal infrared systems.}
 \label{fig:tir_vs_vis_many}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/tir_vs_vis_1_5.png}
 \caption{Progress of survey completeness over a five year survey for a 1-spacecraft and 5-spacecraft system, comparing visual light and thermal infrared.}
 \label{fig:tir_vs_vis_nohybrid}
\end{figure}


As mentioned in the previous section, initial result suggest thermal infrared systems to be the optimal choice for multi-spacecraft systems because of their predicted higher performance in single-spacecraft systems, and higher benefit from increasing the number of spacecraft. The latter effect is shown in \autoref{fig:tir_vs_vis_many}. In this section, the payload composition will be investigated in more detail. Particular interest is placed in the effect of survey length - as visual light systems feature a faster cadence - and in possible synergistic effects in systems featuring both visual light and thermal infrared telescopes. When interpreting the results of this chapter, it is important to keep in mind the fact that these simulations were carried out assuming contemporary hardware. Advances in either type of telescope or sensor might warrant a future reassessment.\\

Firstly, the performances for systems featuring only one payload type were modelled. For comparison, this analysis was carried out for a 1-spacecraft and a 5-spacecraft system. Because, as shown in the previous section, the payload types exhibit similar behavior when the number of spacecraft is altered, this was assumed to be representative of other numbers of spacecraft as well. The resulting survey performance as a function of time can be seen in \autoref{fig:tir_vs_vis_nohybrid}. Note that, contrary to previous figures, these graphs show the \textit{absolute} survey completeness, not the completeness relative to a benchmark. In the results, it can be observed that initially, the visual light system features a higher completeness due to its faster cadence. However, the thermal infrared system quickly surpasses it as time progresses. This means that the faster cadence granted by the lower integration times and larger sensor sizes of the visual light system does not weight up to the increased sensitivity of the thermal infrared system on the timescales of survey missions; not only is the final survey completeness more than 10\% higher for a thermal infrared system, it also manages to achieve the same performance as a 5-year visual light survey in only a single year in both examined cases. This agrees with the findings of \cite{ThesisOlga} that for systems where quick detections are important, such as impact last-warning, thermal infrared is also a superior option. \\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/tir_vs_vis_2_hybrid.png}
 \caption{Progress of survey completeness over a five year survey for all possible payload combinations in a 2-spacecraft system.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \caption{Progress of survey completeness over a five year survey for all possible payload combinations in a 4-spacecraft system.}
 \label{fig:payload_hybrid_two}
\end{figure}

In continuation of the payload analysis, systems utilizing a combination of visual light and thermal infrared telescopes were examined. The reasoning is that the higher sensitivity of thermal infrared systems combined with the higher cadence of visual light systems might result in a synergistic effect where fast, hard to detect NEA's can still be identified successfully. However, as can be seen from the results for 2- and 4-spacecraft systems in \autoref{fig:payload_hybrid_one} and \autoref{fig:payload_hybrid_two}, respectively, this is not the case. A system comprising purely infrared telescopes yields the best results, and performance increases progressively as the number of thermal infrared telescopes in the system increases. This means that in general thermal infrared is the preferred payload type for deep space multi-spacecraft systems. Note however that this assertion is made under the assumption of a ``dumb'' search strategy, where the system simply repeatedly images the entire sky. Possible applications of fast visual light telescopes as ``follow-up'' telescopes - as demonstrated by the Catalina Sky Survey - might still be a feasible option, although this would first require research into such advanced search strategies.

\section{Orbital Elements I: Co-orbital Spacecraft}
\label{sec:results_orbits_one}
Next, the orbital elements of the system are inspected. This is done both to find what the effect is of the orbital elements on the performance, but also how the payload and number of spacecraft affect the optimal orbital elements of the system. To facilitate analysis, and to later judge the results of the optimizer more accurately, the orbits are first analysed for a system of co-orbital spacecraft. That is, all orbital elements, except for the anomaly at epoch, are the same for all spacecraft. In addition, the separation in anomalies of the spacecraft is the same for all spacecraft. This was done to vastly reduce the parameter space, and to reduce accidental overfitting to the population model. The latter follows from the fact that, logically, only the angular distance between the spacecraft should influence the result, not the absolute starting position, as the NEA's are distributed in a radially symmetrical fashion. I.e., a system with two spacecraft at mean anomaly at epoch $0$ and $\pi$ should give the same result as starting at $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$, only the inter-spacecraft distance is relevant.\\

\subsection{Semi-major axis}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/vis_semi_maj.png}
 \caption{Visual light survey performance as a function of semi-major axis for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:vis_semi_maj}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/tir_semi_maj.png}
 \caption{Thermal infrared survey performance as a function of semi-major axis for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:tir_semi_maj}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:vis_semi_maj}, the expected survey performance as a function of semi-major axis is shown for visual light systems, and in \autoref{fig:tir_semi_maj} for thermal infrared systems. Contrary to the number of spacecraft, it is clear that the semi-major axis has an optimal value. In addition, the region surrounding the optimum is very flat. Thus, locally, the solution is not sensitive to changes in semi-major axis up to a distance of approximately $0.1~\mathrm{AU}$ from the optimum. Two important conclusions are drawn here: Firstly, a wide range of semi-major axes lead to a well performing system. Secondly, due to the variance in results discussed earlier, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact optimal value. Therefore, in mission design, other considerations can and should be prioritized to determine a more precise semi-major axis. \\

The second factor of note is the change in the optimal semi-major axis as the number of spacecraft increases. It can be observed that for visual light systems, the optimal semi-major axis is essentially unchanging for $n \leq 5$. However, for thermal infrared systems, there is clearly an increase in optimal semi-major axis as $n$ increases. This is further illustrated in \autoref{fig:semi_maj_function_of_n}, where the optimal semi-major axis is given as a function of the number of spacecraft explicitly. Here, it can be observed that the optimizer indeed has difficulty pinpointing the exact optimum, but instead finishes on a value somewhere in the optimal range. In addition, the semi-major axis becomes larger for higher numbers of spacecraft for thermal infrared systems. For visual light systems at higher numbers of spacecraft this also starts to occur. An explanation for this phenomenon is proposed in \autoref{sec:results_explanation}.

 \label{fig:semi_maj_function_of_n}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Eccentricity}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/vis_ecc.png}
 \caption{Visual light survey performance as a function of eccentricity for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:vis_ecc}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/tir_ecc.png}
 \caption{Thermal infrared survey performance as a function of eccentricity for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:tir_ecc}
\end{figure}

Results with regards to varying the eccentricity are shown in \autoref{fig:vis_ecc} for visual light systems and \autoref{fig:tir_ecc} for thermal infrared systems. It is readily apparent that for both systems, a circular orbit is preferred. It is hypothesized that this is the case because eccentricity causes the system to deviate from the optimal semi-major axis found in the previous subsection. This is further supported by the empirical finding that the optimal semi-major axis at a given eccentricity results in an apohelion distance roughly equal to the optimal semi-major axis at 0 eccentricity. That is:
\begin{equation}
 a_{opt}(e) \approx \frac{a_{opt}(0)}{1+e}
\end{equation}
This is further illustrated in \autoref{fig:eccentricity_optimal}. This result is theorized to occur because the spacecraft will, in this solution, still spend a large portion of its orbit in the optimal semi-major axis range. However, not enough data are available to ascertain statistical significance for this finding.

 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/eccentricity_optimal.png}
 \caption{Relationship between optimal semi-major axis, eccentricity, and the resulting perihelion for 1-5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:eccentricity_optimal}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Mean Anomaly at Epoch}
\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/spread_illustration.png}
 \caption{Illustration of a high ($2\pi/5~\mathrm{rad}$ and a low ($0.3~\mathrm{rad}$) inter-spacecraft distance.}
 \label{fig:spread_illustration}
\end{figure}

The last parameter to be considered for the co-orbital solutions is the mean anomaly at epoch. As previously explained, the mean anomaly will not be considered for each spacecraft separately. Instead, the concept of inter-spacecraft spread is introduced. This inter-spacecraft spread is simply defined as the difference in anomaly at epoch of one spacecraft to the next, in such a way that the formation is centered around $\theta=0$. This means that, with inter-spacecraft spread $\Delta \theta$, the mean anomaly at epoch $\theta$ of spacecraft $n$ in a system of $N$ spacecraft is:
\begin{equation}
 \theta_n = (n-1) \cdot \Delta \theta - \frac{N-1}{2}\Delta \theta
\end{equation}
This equation and the resulting formation is shown in \autoref{fig:spread_illustration}. A lower boundary of 0.3 rad was chosen to ensure triangulation would remain possible. In addition, to maintain the separation between all spacecraft, the full formation can not span more than $2\pi$ rad. This results in the boundaries $0.3 \leq \Delta \theta \leq 2\pi/N$. The hypothesized effect of changing the spread is composed of two effects: On the one hand, spreading out the spacecraft more allows for viewing a larger portion of the sky simultaneously, and reduces blind spots, as explained in REFFF. On the other hand, as spacecraft are closer together, the chances of obtaining a simultaneous detection of the same asteroid - and thereby achieving triangulation - is increased, thereby leading to a faster detection.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/vis_spread.png}
 \caption{Visual light survey performance as a function of angular separation between spacecraft for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:vis_spread}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/tir_spread.png}
 \caption{Thermal infrared survey performance as a function of angular separation between spacecraft for 1 to 5 spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:tir_spread}
\end{figure}

Results for visual light and thermal infrared are shown in \autoref{fig:vis_spread} and \autoref{fig:tir_spread}, respectively. It is observed that an increase in the angular distance between the spacecraft will increase the performance of the system. Therefore, the effect of observing a larger part of the sky effectively is stronger than the increased chance at succesful triangulation. Practically, this implies that a multi-spacecraft survey should aim to distribute the spacecraft as much as possible over the orbit, even if e.g. communications requirements do not allow the system to be spread out over the entire orbit.

\section{Orbital Elements II: Non Co-orbital Spacecraft}
\label{sec:results_orbits_two}
A logical continuation of the above analysis would be to investigate systems in which all spacecraft are allowed to have different orbital elements per spacecraft. This complicates the analysis significantly, as the dimensionality of the problem rapidly increases. Therefore, additional special attention has to be paid to the performance of the optimizer, and to run validation tests on its results. In addition, to aid in comparison, three sets of optimization parameters were analysed. Firstly, a system which has all spacecraft spread out as much as possible, in a single circular orbit. From the results in the previous section, it follows that this is the optimal solution. Secondly, a system in which each spacecraft can have a distinct semi-major axis and anomaly at epoch. Because spacecraft with different semi-major axes have different orbital periods, the spacecraft can not be spread out evenly a priori. Therefore, the optimizer has to take care of this task as well, and not just the semi-major axes. Lastly, a similar set of parameters is analysed, but with orbits that are allowed to be non-circular. In that case, the parameter space comprises a semi-major axis, true anomaly at epoch, and eccentricity for each spacecraft.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/performance_free.png}
 \caption{Performances for systems optimized for either a single semi-major axis, distinct semi-major axes and anomalies per spacecraft, or distinct semi-major axes, anomalies and eccentricities per spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:performance_free}
\end{figure}
The results of the optimization processes can be seen in \autoref{fig:performance_free}. It can be seen that several performance breakpoints are present: for low numbers of spacecraft, approximately $1 \leq n \leq 5$, all three methods result in similar performances. Then, for approximately $6 \leq n \leq 10$, the performance of the optimization including eccentricity starts degrading relative to the other two. Lastly, for $n > 10$, the ``simple'' solution with the spacecraft in the same orbit, spaced equally, is superior to the other two methods. These results might be surprising to some readers: one would expect the performance to either increase, or stay equal, as more parameters become available to the optimizer. After all, all solutions found for a circular, co-orbital system of spacecraft (i.e. only a single semi-major axis gets determined by the optimizer), can be recreated by the other two optimizers, and therefore they can reach the same performance. The source of this discrepancy is twofold. The first aspect is the problem of the optimizer overfitting to the noise in the system. The second aspect is related to the actual performance benefits obtainable through these more complex solutions. Although the results here might seem inconclusive, the combination of both aspects will allow drawing some important conclusions.\\

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/overfit_free.png}
 \caption{Overfit of the optimizer per number of spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:overfit_free}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/overfit_free_cumulative_average.png}
 \caption{Cumulative average of the overfit of the optimizer per number of spacecraft.}
 \label{fig:overfit_free_cumulative_average}
\end{figure}

First, the problem of overfit will be adressed. To illustrate the occurence of overfit at higher dimensionalities, \autoref{fig:overfit_free} gives the overfit for each optimization problem, per spacecraft. Overfit is defined simply as the difference between the learning performance (i.e. the performance predicted by the optimizer for its solution) and the validation performance (the actual performance which can be expected at the solution). As \autoref{fig:overfit_free} is hard to interpret directly, \autoref{fig:overfit_free_cumulative_average} provides the cumulative average up to and including a certain number of spacecraft. Several observations are made here:
\begin{itemize}
 \item As the number of spacecraft increases, the average overfit of the single semi-major axis system decreases. In other words, for a higher number of spacecraft, the optimizer performs better. This occurs because, in this system, the dimensionality does not increase, and therefore the task of the optimizer is equally hard. However, as the distribution of spacecraft becomes more uniform, the system will overfit less to the population as the importance of the starting position of each spacecraft becomes smaller. In other words, a higher number of spacecraft incurs a regularizing effect on the optimizer.
 \item Secondly, the average overfit for the system with distinct semi-major axis and anomaly, but no eccentricity, per spacecraft, exhibits no statistically significant slope. The degree over overfit levels out around 1-1.5\%. At this degree of overfitting, the optimizer is capable of finding a solution to the problem. 
 \item Lastly, the system optimized for semi-major axis, anomaly and eccentricity, shows an \textit{increase} in overfitting. I.e., the optimizer is not capable of keeping up with the increasing dimensionality of the problem, and the quality of the result continually decreases.
\end{itemize}
Before investigating the second point, first some of the solutions of the optimizer will be examined, along with their training progress. The solutions to be investigated are two, six and eleven spacecraft. The one spacecraft case is omitted as the optimal solution is already known from previous analysis to be the optimal solution to the single semi-major axis system. The six and eleven spacecraft cases were chosen as they represent the first solution after the performance breakpoints discussed earlier.
